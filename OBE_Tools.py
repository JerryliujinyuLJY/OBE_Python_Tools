    assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities for a given 
    temperature and atomic mass explicitly (without using Scipy).
    Defaults to Caesium (the best atom) at room temperature. 

    Args:
        velocities (1D array): atomic velocities in units of m/s
        temp (int, optional): Temperature of the atomic ensemble 
            in degrees Celsius. Defaults to 20 deg C (room temp).
        mass (float, optional): Mass number of the atomic species used 
            in atomic mass units. Defaults to 132.90545 amu (Caesium).

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: relative abundances of the specified velocities 
            according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 
            will be the same shape as velocities.
